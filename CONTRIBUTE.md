Get started
===========

Sorry but at the moment this project only contains source code for integration with IntelliJ
(written to be used with Groovy and [live-plugin](https://github.com/dkandalov/live-plugin)).

All the interesting bits like analysing and visualizing code history were moved out of this project.
I plan to publish them as separate projects when the code is "good enough".
In the meantime you can look at:
 - [components for d3.js charts and graphs](https://github.com/dkandalov/d3-components)
 - [java library for reading commit information from git/svn](https://github.com/dkandalov/vcs-reader)
