### What is this?

This is a plugin for [IntelliJ](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community) IDEs to grab
and analyze project source code history. You can install it from plugin manager
or download from [plugin repository](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7273).

Take a look at examples of visualizations:
 - [JUnit code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/JUnit.html)
 - [TestNG code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/TestNG.html)
 - [Cucumber code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/Cucumber.html)
 - [Scala code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/Scala.html)
 - [Clojure code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/Clojure.html)
 - [Kotlin code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/Kotlin.html)
 - [Groovy code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/Groovy.html)
 - [CoffeeScript code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/CoffeeScript.html)
 - [Go code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/Go.html)
 - [Maven code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/Maven.html)
 - [Gradle code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/Gradle.html)
 - [Ruby code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/Ruby.html)
 - [Ruby on Rails code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/Rails.html)
 - [Node.js code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/NodeJS.html)
 - [Aeron code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/Aeron.html)
 - [ANTLR4 code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/ANTLR4.html)
 - [GHC code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/GHC.html)
 - [IntelliJ code history](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining/idea.html)

Csv files with data for the above visualizations are available [here on google drive](https://googledrive.com/host/0B5PfR1lF8o5SZE1xMXZIWGxBVzQ).

See also [command line version of code-history-mining](http://dkandalov.github.io/code-history-mining-cli).


### Why?
There seems to be a lot of interesting data captured in version control systems, yet we don't use it that much.
This is an attempt to make looking at project history easier.

 - converting history to csv is useful because it's easy to read and process in any language (or even in a spreadsheet)
 - interactive visualization is cool because it's fun to play with and can hopefully give deeper insight into project history


### How to use?
The plugin has two parts:
 - reading project history from version control and saving it as csv file
 - reading history from csv, analyzing and visualizing it with [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) (needs a browser with SVG support)

#### Grab VCS history into csv
"Main menu -> VCS -> Code History Mining" or "alt + shift + H".

 - **From/To** - desired dates for project history. Commits are loaded from version control only if they are not already in csv file.
 - **Save to** - file to save history to.
 - **Grab history on VCS update** - grab history on update from VCS so that it contains events from specified date until today.
 This will happen at most once a day.
 - **Grab change size in lines/characters** - grab amount of lines and characters before/after commit and size of change.
 Please note that this requires loading file content and can slow down grabbing history.

#### Visualize
By default cvs files with history are saved to "[\<plugins folder\>](http://devnet.jetbrains.com/docs/DOC-181)/code-history-mining" folder.
Files from this folder are displayed in plugin menu.
All visualizations are self-contained one file pages (i.e. you should be able to save them as standalone files).

### Limitations
 - all VCS supported by IntelliJ should work but I only tried Git and Svn
 - visualisations are only tested Chrome (but should work in Safari, Firefox)
 - some of visualisations might be slow for long history of a big project
 (e.g. building treemap view of commits for project with 1M LOC for 10 years might take forever).
 In this case, filtering or splitting history into smaller chunks can help.


### Code history csv format
Each commit is broken down into several lines. One line corresponds to one file changed in commit.
Commits are stored ordered by time from present to past as they are read from VCS
(although there might be exceptions because VCSs don't guarantee this order).

Columns:
 - __commit date__ - in "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z" format with local timezone (see [javadoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html) for details).
 - __revision__ - format depends on underlying VCS.
 - __author__ - committer name from VCS.
 - __file name before change__ - empty if file was added or name didn't change.
 - __file name after change__ - empty if file was deleted.
 - __path to file before change__ - empty if file was added, path didn't change or file is in root folder.
 - __path to file after change__ - empty if files was deleted or is in root folder.
 - __change type__ - can be "NEW", "MODIFICATION", "MOVED" or "DELETED". Renaming or moving file is "MOVED" even if file content has changed.
 - __number of lines in file before change__ - "-1" if file is binary or "Grab change size" checkbox is not selected in "Grab Project History" dialog;
   "-2" if file is too big for IntelliJ to diff.
 - __number of lines in file after change__ - similar to above.
 - __number of lines added__ - similar to above.
 - __number of lines modified__ - similar to above.
 - __number of lines removed__ - similar to above.
 - __number of chars in file before change__ - similar to above.
 - __number of chars in file after change__ - similar to above.
 - __number of chars added__ - similar to above.
 - __number of chars modified__ - similar to above.
 - __number of chars removed__ - similar to above.
 - __commit message__ - new line breaks are replaced with "\\n".


Output csv format should be compatible with [RFC4180](http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4180.html).
